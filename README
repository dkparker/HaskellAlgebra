This is my file for working on my haskell algebra project.

Algebra.hs: A module defining typeclasses for Groups, Rings, and Fields

Int_and_RatNum.hs: A module defining (Z,+,*) as a Ring, defining a RatNum type for rational numbers, and making (Q,+,*) an instance of Field

xor.hs: A module defining integers with the operation xor how the bitwise xor

Symmetric.hs: A module defining the symmetric group of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}, where each bijection is an array, as an instance of group. Symmetric.hs must be run with the flag -XFlexibleInstances
